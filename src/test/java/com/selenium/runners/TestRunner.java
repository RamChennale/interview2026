/**
 * Cucumber + TestNG Test Runner.
 *
 * Extending AbstractTestNGCucumberTests turns every Cucumber scenario into its own
 * TestNG @Test, so scenarios show up individually in TestNG/Surefire/Jenkins reports
 * and can be executed in parallel (see the "dataprovider" thread count in testng.xml).
 *
 * NOTE: "tags" is intentionally NOT set here. Values set via @CucumberOptions take
 * precedence over system properties/environment variables/cucumber.properties, which
 * would make -Dcucumber.filter.tags impossible to override from Maven/Jenkins. Instead,
 * the default tag expression lives in src/test/resources/cucumber.properties, and
 * Surefire forwards -Dcucumber.filter.tags as a system property that overrides it, e.g.:
 *   mvn clean test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke"
